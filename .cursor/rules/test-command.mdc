# Running automated tests

- Use `make test` every time you need to run tests or I ask you to
- For running specific tests, use `make test TEST="-run TestName"` where TestName is the name of the test you want to run
- Never use `go test` directly, always use the make command 
- Never run the application with `make` or `make run` to test your changes. Always run `make test` instead. If you just want to test if the code builds, then use `make build`

# When to update existing tests

Every time you do a change in the implementation we'll need to re-run the tests to make sure nothing broken or if we need to update some existing tests. Make sure to run the tests at the end.

# When to add new tests

Every time we create new "cases" in our logic we'll need to create tests to make sure the new logic is working correctly. Make sure to run the tests at the end.
